                    Hello,
                    You've registered yourself for Yuzu Online's competitive MK8DX Lounge Event as {player['name']}.
                    However, you have not yet played any events. We try to keep the ranking list clean of inactive players, so **we have marked you as 'inactive'**.
                    \n
                    If you don't want your registration deleted, simply **use the '/reactivate' slash command** here or in the server's Lounge channels. This shows us that you still want to play.
                    Otherwise, all registrations marked for deletion **will be removed from the leaderboard** and deleted after about **2 days**.
                    \n
                    Don't worry, even if this happens, you can simply re-register later in https://discord.com/channels/1084911987626094654/1181312934803144724 .
